# Phase 4 questions:
# Our booking system does not use consent (except for accepting the terms of service, but this is a slightly different matter). 
    Is this good? Explain (100 words)
        - Not using consent in a booking system, except for accepting terms of service, can be acceptable if no sensitive personal data is collected or processed.
        However, it may lead to transparency issues and lack of user trust if users are unaware of how their data is handled. Incorporating clear consent mechanisms for optional data collection ensures compliance with privacy regulations and builds user confidence. While terms of service acceptance is necessary, explicit consent is crucial where legally required or for ethical transparency.
# Choose an example page where consent is required.
    Tell us which one you chose. Tell us why consent is required? (100 words)
        - I chose terveystalo.fi and consent is required because the website processes sensitive personal data, such as health information.
        Under regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), explicit consent is mandatory for collecting and handling sensitive data, including health records, to ensure privacy and data protection. This consent ensures users are informed about how their data will be used (e.g., for booking, medical purposes, or further communication) and provides them control over its processing.
        Without explicit consent, processing such sensitive information would be unlawful and could compromise user trust.
