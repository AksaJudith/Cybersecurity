# Phase 3, the 5 most important points that I think should be fixed as soon as possible:

| # 1  | CSP: Wildcard Directive |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is wrong? | The form-action directive in the Content Security Policy (CSP) is not set or is overly broad, effectively allowing any source. This weakens protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. |
| How did I find it? | Detected as a Medium-risk issue in the ZAP report. The evidence highlights that the form-action directive is missing or incorrectly configured. |
| How should it work? / What should be fixed? | Set the form-action directive explicitly in the CSP header to restrict which origins can handle form submissions. For example: Content-Security-Policy: form-action 'self'; |

| # 2  | Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is wrong? | The CSP header is not set for critical endpoints (/login and /static), leaving the application vulnerable to XSS and data injection attacks. |
| How did I find it? | Reported as a Medium-risk issue in the ZAP report with 2 instances identified. |
| How should it work? / What should be fixed? | Add a robust CSP header to your server configuration. For example: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; |

| # 3  | X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is wrong? | The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set to nosniff, which allows older browsers to perform MIME-sniffing, potentially misinterpreting file types and increasing the risk of injection attacks. |
| How did I find it? | Identified as a Low-risk issue in the ZAP report with evidence from a GET request to /static/styles.css. |
| How should it work? / What should be fixed? | Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to nosniff in your server configuration: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff |

| # 4 | Authentication Request Identified (Informational) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is wrong? | Sensitive parameters like username and password are present in the request payload without strong validation or encryption, increasing the risk of interception or misuse. |
| How did I find it? | Highlighted as an informational alert in the ZAP report for the /login endpoint. |
| How should it work? / What should be fixed? | Ensure that all sensitive data is transmitted over HTTPS. Validate and sanitize input server-side to mitigate potential injection attacks. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security. |

| # 5  | User Agent Fuzzer (Informational) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is wrong? | The application behaves inconsistently for different User-Agent headers, potentially exposing functionality or vulnerabilities specific to certain clients. |
| How did I find it? | Detected in 48 instances, showing varying responses for different User-Agent strings. |
| How should it work? / What should be fixed? | Ensure consistent responses for all User-Agent strings. Avoid revealing unnecessary information or different behaviors that could aid attackers in fingerprinting your application. |
